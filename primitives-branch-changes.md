# Primitives Branch Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes between the current `primitives` branch and `upstream/dev`.

## New Files Added

### 1. **Documentation - Prim Component** (`docs/scripting/nodes/types/Prim.md`)
- Comprehensive documentation for the new `Prim` node type
- Creates primitive 3D shapes with built-in geometry caching for optimal performance
- Supported shapes: `box`, `sphere`, `cylinder`, `cone`, `torus`, `plane`

#### Key Features:
- **Material Properties**: color, emissive, metalness, roughness, opacity, transparency
- **Texturing**: Support for texture URLs with async loading and caching
- **Physics Integration**: 
  - Static, kinematic, and dynamic body types
  - Collision detection with callbacks
  - Trigger volumes
  - Automatic collision shape generation
- **Performance**: Automatic instancing for primitives with identical materials
- **Double-sided rendering**: Option for planes to be visible from both sides

### 2. **Test Scripts**

#### `prim-arena-test.js`
- Interactive arena with collectible rings game
- Tests trigger volumes and collision detection
- Features:
  - 40x40 arena with walls and obstacles
  - 20 collectible golden rings with particle effects
  - Score tracking and respawn mechanics
  - Glowing crystal ambient lighting

#### `prim-physics-test.js`
- Comprehensive physics testing for all primitive types
- Tests convex mesh colliders for non-box/sphere shapes
- Grid layout showing:
  - All 6 primitive types (box, sphere, cylinder, cone, torus, plane)
  - All 3 physics types (static, kinematic, dynamic)
  - Trigger zones for collision detection
  - Animated kinematic objects
  - Dynamic test ball with periodic impulses

#### `prim-showcase.js`
- Visual showcase of all primitive types
- Animated demonstrations:
  - Rotating box
  - Bouncing sphere
  - Spinning cylinder
  - Wobbling cone
  - Multi-axis rotating torus
  - Waving plane
- Labels for each primitive type

#### `prim-stress-test.js`
- Performance test with 50,000 primitives
- Smart material distribution for realistic usage patterns
- Features:
  - Configurable texture upload via props
  - 15 predefined materials (80% common, 20% special)
  - LOD system with distance-based rendering
  - Performance monitoring (FPS, draw calls, instance count)
  - Real-time stats display
  - Animated sections for visual interest

## Technical Implementation Details

### Geometry Caching
- Primitives with identical properties share geometry
- Reduces memory usage and improves performance

### Physics Shapes
- Box and sphere: Exact physics collision shapes
- Cylinder, cone, torus: Use convex mesh approximations
- Plane: Uses thin box for collision
- Bottom-aligned positioning (y=0 at base)

### Material Instancing
- Primitives with identical materials are automatically instanced
- Material changes require rebuilding the primitive instance

### Texture System
- Asynchronous texture loading
- Texture caching - multiple primitives can share loaded textures
- Supports common image formats (PNG, JPG, etc.)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Geometry Instancing**: Identical primitives share GPU resources
2. **Material Batching**: Similar materials are grouped for fewer draw calls
3. **LOD System**: Distance-based rendering in stress test
4. **Smart Material Distribution**: Realistic material usage patterns for better batching

## Use Cases

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick creation of 3D scenes without external models
2. **Physics Playgrounds**: Easy setup of physics-enabled environments
3. **Performance Testing**: Built-in stress test for benchmarking
4. **Game Mechanics**: Trigger zones, collectibles, and interactive elements
5. **Visual Effects**: Emissive materials and transparency for special effects

## API Example

```javascript
// Create a glowing, textured, physics-enabled sphere
const sphere = app.create('prim', {
  kind: 'sphere',
  size: [1],
  position: [0, 1, 0],
  color: '#4488ff',
  emissive: '#4488ff',
  emissiveIntensity: 2,
  texture: 'https://example.com/texture.jpg',
  physics: {
    type: 'dynamic',
    mass: 1,
    restitution: 0.8,
    onContactStart: (other) => {
      console.log('Collision with:', other)
    }
  }
})
```

This update significantly enhances Hyperfy's built-in 3D capabilities, making it easier to create interactive 3D experiences without external modeling tools.
