# Changes Summary - Primitive Node Implementation

## Overview
This branch adds a new `Prim` node type for creating instanced primitive 3D shapes with per-instance color and emissive support.

## New Features

### 1. Prim Node (`src/core/nodes/Prim.js`)
- New node type for creating primitive 3D shapes (box, sphere, cylinder, cone, torus, plane)
- Efficient instanced rendering with shared geometry
- Per-instance color support
- Per-instance emissive support with customizable intensity
- Size controlled via scale transformation for optimal performance
- Full property validation and error handling

### 2. Enhanced Stage System (`src/core/systems/Stage.js`)
- **Refactored Model class**: Removed primitive-specific code for cleaner separation of concerns
- **New Primitive class**: Extends Model to handle instanced primitives with color/emissive support
- **New `insertPrimitive` method**: Dedicated method for inserting primitives
- **Shader modifications**: Custom vertex/fragment shader modifications to support:
  - Per-instance colors (RGB)
  - Per-instance emissive colors with intensity (RGBA)
- **Optimized buffer management**: Dynamic resizing of instance attribute buffers

### 3. Documentation (`docs/scripting/nodes/types/Prim.md`)
- Comprehensive documentation for the Prim node
- Property descriptions for all supported attributes
- Multiple usage examples including:
  - Basic primitive creation
  - Color and emissive usage
  - Dynamic property updates
  - Animation examples

### 4. Stress Test (`prim-stress-test.js`)
- Performance testing script creating 1000 primitives
- Demonstrates:
  - All primitive types
  - Random colors using HSL
  - Emissive with varying intensities
  - Debug logging for troubleshooting

## Technical Details

### Instancing Architecture
- All primitives of the same type share a single geometry
- Uses THREE.InstancedMesh for efficient rendering
- Per-instance attributes stored in Float32Arrays
- Dynamic buffer resizing when instance count grows

### Shader Implementation
- Modifies Three.js MeshStandardMaterial shaders at runtime
- Injects custom attributes and varyings
- Color applied to diffuseColor in fragment shader
- Emissive added to totalEmissiveRadiance with intensity support

### API Design
- Emissive can be specified as:
  - String color (default intensity 1.0)
  - Object with `{color, intensity}` properties
  - null for no emission
- Size property intelligently maps to shape dimensions
- Real-time property updates without rebuilding

## Performance Considerations
- Geometry caching prevents duplicate geometry creation
- Shared material for all primitives
- Efficient instance swapping when removing primitives
- Minimal shader overhead with conditional emissive application

## Breaking Changes
None - this is a new feature addition

## Future Enhancements
- Additional primitive types (capsule, octahedron, etc.)
- Texture support for primitives
- Normal map support
- Metalness/roughness per-instance attributes
