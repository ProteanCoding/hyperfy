# Git Diff Summary: upstream/prim vs origin/colorwheel

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes between `upstream/prim` and `origin/colorwheel` branches.

## Key Changes

### 1. Package Dependencies (package.json & package-lock.json)
**Added dependency:**
- `react-colorful` (v5.6.1) - A tiny color picker component for React

### 2. New ColorWheel Field Type

#### Fields.js Component (`src/client/components/Fields.js`)
Added a new `FieldColorWheel` component that provides:
- A color picker UI using the `HexColorPicker` from react-colorful
- Click-to-open color picker with a preview swatch
- Hex color display in monospace font
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Smooth integration with the existing field system

**Features:**
- Shows current color as a swatch and hex value
- Opens a floating color picker on click
- Updates color in real-time while picking
- Commits color change when picker is closed

#### Sidebar.js Integration (`src/client/components/Sidebar.js`)
- Added support for the new `colorwheel` field type in the `AppField` component
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing props system

### 3. Example Implementation (`prim-switcher.js`)
Updated the primitive switcher demo to showcase the new color wheel:
- Changed the color field from `type: 'text'` to `type: 'colorwheel'`
- Removed the hex placeholder text in favor of the visual color picker
- Added a hint: "Choose a color for the primitive"

**Also includes minor formatting changes:**
- Added trailing commas for better git diffs
- Consistent code formatting

## Technical Details

The color wheel implementation:
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for state management
- Implements click-outside detection for closing the picker
- Maintains local state while picking, only updating on close
- Styled with CSS-in-JS using emotion
- Custom styling for the react-colorful component to match the app's design

## Summary
This branch introduces a professional color picker field type to the Hyperfy platform, replacing text-based hex input with an intuitive visual color selection tool. The implementation is clean, reusable, and follows the existing patterns in the codebase.
